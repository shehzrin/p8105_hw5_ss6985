## Problem 1

Create a function for size n that randomly draws birthdays for each
person, checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group, and
returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on the result.

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n 
  return(duplicate)
}
```

Run this function 10,000 times for each group size between 2 and 50.

``` r
sim_res =
  expand_grid(n = 2:50,
              iter = 1:10000) |>
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |>
  group_by(n) |>
  summarize(prob = mean(res))
```

Make a plot showing the probability that at least two people in the
group will share a birthday (by averaging across 10,000 simulation runs
for each group size between 2 and 50) as a function of group size.

``` r
sim_res |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Probability of Shared Birthday in a Group",
       x = "Group Size",
       y = "Probability of Shared Birthday")
```

As n (# of people in a room) increases, the probability of a shared
birthday increases. When the group size is about 22 people, the
probability of a shared birthday is about 50%. With a group size of 50,
the probability is nearly 100% which suggests it is almost certain or
extremely likely that at least two people in the group will share a
birthday. I expect that increasing the group size even more would, at
some point, result in a 100% probability of a shared birthday.
